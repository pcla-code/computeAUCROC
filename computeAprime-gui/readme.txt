Simple A' algorithm assumes that labels for the data in the input file 
is stored in the column named 'right'. It computes A' for the model 
specified. If 2 model names are given, then A' will be computed for both of them.
Also, appriopriate delimiter for the input file should be set. 

Please note, that the delimiter option is only relevant for the Simple A' algorithm.
For A' per student, the input file should be tab delimited and sorted on student.
